Profile Card

A simple, responsive profile card built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project was created as part of the HNG internship tasks.

## Features

- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Responsive layout for small screens and desktop
- Lightweight, no build tools or dependencies

## Files

- `index.html` — main page containing the profile card markup
- `style.css` — styles and responsive rules
- `script.js` — small JavaScript used by the demo (if any)
- `public/` — static assets (images, icons) used by the page
- `README.md` — this file

## How to view locally

Glone this repository, and then open `index.html` in your browser. 
The project has no build step or external dependencies.


```

## Notes

- This project intentionally avoids frameworks to stay small and easy to read.
- If you add images, place them under `public/` and reference them from `index.html`.
